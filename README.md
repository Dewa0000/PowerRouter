1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
File: LongestSubstringWithoutRepeating.java
Description: This program finds the longest substring in a given string that doesn't contain any duplicate characters. It utilizes a sliding window approach and a hashmap to efficiently solve the problem.
2. Generating String Permutations
File: StringPermutations.java
Description: This program generates all permutations of a given string. It uses a recursive algorithm to compute all possible permutations of the input string.
3. Checking Anagrams Using Character Counts
File: AnagramChecker.java
Description: This program checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other using character count comparison. It utilizes an array to count the occurrences of characters in the strings.
4. Implementing Stack Using Queues
File: StackUsingQueues.java
Description: This program implements a stack using two queues. It achieves stack operations like push, pop, and top using two queues to simulate the behavior of a stack.
5. Reversing a String
File: ReverseString.java
Description: This program reverses a given string by using two pointers to swap characters from the start and end of the string until they meet at the middle.
6. Generating Fibonacci Series
File: FibonacciSeries.java
Description: This program generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified position. It calculates the series using an iterative approach without using recursion.
